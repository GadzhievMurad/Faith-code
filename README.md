## About schedules

we will be basing on Islamic Calendar. So as we know the Islamic day begins **at sunset** because the calendar is lunar and the months begin with the sighting of the crescent shortly after sunset

Before we begin, I must clarify that this schedule is developed exactly for me. Your schedule can be different. Thus you can copy this file and customize It how you want, but keep in mind that main statements, like Islamic Calendar, Day Open (and etc.) could be unchanged.
